# DOM Proxy PoC
A PoC for a malicious Confluence plugin that relays communication from the attacker's server to the Confluence instance via the browser of a Confluence user. 

This was done as a bypass for a server that could not reach the internet, and we, as the attackers, still wanted to interact with it after uploading our malicious plugin.
